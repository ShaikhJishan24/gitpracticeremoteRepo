WHAT IS SIGNIFIANCE OF OS

WHAT IS OOPS 
--WAY OF NATURAL THINKING WHERE WE STATR FROM OutPut NEEDED UNDERSTANDING PROCESS AND THEN START WITH INPUT

KERNAL
MONOLITHIC ONE LARGE CODE CAPABLE OF DOING EVERYTHING 
-VE--MAINTING MANAGNING PDATING WOULD ALWAYS BE TROUBLESHOOT RESTART ON EVERY CHANGE
MICRO--CODE ONLY PROVIDES INTERFACE TO USE VARIOUS DEVICES AND SERVICES MANAGING CODE DONE ENTIRE BY THE APPLICSTION AND TH ECODER
-VE--APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGING BECOME DIFFICULT ISSUES/SPEED ISSUES 
+VE--NO RESTART
HYBRID--BEST OF BOTH MAJOR SERVICES AND ACCESS BY KERNEL BUT CAN ADDD NEW NEEDED MODULE

SHELL
--HE IS ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF LINUX KERNEL
TYPES OF SHELL-
1.BASH(BOURNE AGAIN SHELL)
2.CSH()
